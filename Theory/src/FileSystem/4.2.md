## NTFS

New Technology File System (NTFS) is a proprietary journaling file system developed by Microsoft in 1993, supporting:

- Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- Encryption
- Transparent compression
- Sparse files
- Journaling
- POSIX support (no, not WSL)
- Multiple data streams

A nice feature is that everything is a file!  

- Except for the Volume Boot Record (VBR), everything else is considered a data area.  
- Any sector (except VBR) can be allocated to a file.  
- A very scalable design where internal structures can change over time.  
- Generic data structures embed specific content.

Each unit of information associated with a file is implemented as a file attribute (NTFS Object Attribute). Each attribute consists of a byte stream. 

Key points about NTFS attributes:

- The contents of a file are treated as 'an attribute,' similar to its name or timestamps.
- Each file has a special `$DATA` attribute with no name that corresponds to its content.

Applications can create additional named streams, called Alternate Data Streams (ADS).

- For example, the `$Zone.Identifier` is used by Windows to mark files downloaded from the web.
- You can list ADSs using `dir /r` or tools like `streams`.
- You can set or show their contents by redirecting commands like `echo` and `more`.

When mounting NTFS file systems, consider specifying:

- `show_sys_files` to display metafiles in directory listings.
- `streams_interface=windows` to access ADS like in Windows.

Refer to `mount.ntfs(8)` for more details.

Hard links allow multiple paths to refer to the same file (not directory):

```bash
mklink /h new-name existing-name
```

- Similar to Unix, they are reference-counted and limited to the same file system.

Soft links are strings interpreted dynamically and can point to files, directories, or non-existent targets:

```bash
mklink new-name existing-name
```

- Implemented as reparse points (files or directories containing application-specific reparse data and a 32-bit reparse tag).


Junctions are a legacy concept, functioning almost identically to directory symbolic links. See [ARIS21] for more details.

Shortcuts are `.lnk` files interpreted by Explorer.

### Volume Organization

NTFS maps the entire volume into \textcolor{blue}{clusters}, which are the smallest allocatable units of storage.  

This is different from FAT, which uses a simpler allocation table.

The \textcolor{blue}{cluster factor} (size of a cluster) depends on the size of the volume.  
It is an integral number of physical sectors and always a power of 2.  

- Larger clusters:
    - Reduce fragmentation.
    - Speed up allocation.
    - However, they can lead to *wasted space* (internal fragmentation) when storing small files.

1. Logical Cluster Numbers (LCNs) 

LCNs are used to number clusters sequentially from the beginning of the volume.  
They represent the physical location of clusters on the disk.

2. Virtual Cluster Numbers (VCNs)

VCNs are used to address data within a file.  
They represent the logical view of a file's data.  
VCNs are not necessarily physically contiguous, allowing NTFS to handle fragmented files efficiently.

**Volume Layout**

1. No Fixed Layout:
   - NTFS does not have a fixed layout for the volume, except for the Volume Boot Record (VBR).
   - The VBR contains information that guides the system to the \textcolor{blue}{s}, which is the core of NTFS.

2. 8-bit Sizes Interpretation:
   - Sizes in NTFS are represented as 8-bit values.
   - Positive values indicate the number of clusters.
   - Negative values are interpreted as 2^n, where `n` is the negative value.

**Master File Table**
The MFT is the heart of the NTFS volume structure. It is implemented as an array of file records (similar to inodes). Key details include:

- The size of each record can be defined at format time (typically 1 KB or 4 KB).
- The size depends on the underlying physical medium:
    - Disks with 4 KB sector sizes generally use 4 KB file records.
    - Older disks with 512-byte sectors use 1 KB file records.
- The size does not depend on the cluster size.

When a file needs more metadata space, the base file record stores the location of additional records. The MFT's location is specified in the BIOS Parameter Block inside the VBR.

Key points about the MFT:

- The MFT contains one record for each file, including itself (the first entry).
- It can be fragmented; however, an MFT zone is typically reserved during formatting (about 12.5% of the entire volume).
- In addition to file records, there are other system metadata files. These hidden files have names that begin with a dollar sign (`$`).

**File records for metadata files**

NTFS incorporates \textcolor{blue}{fixup values} into data structures that are over one sector in length

- the last two bytes of each sector are replaced with a “signature” value
- the signature is later used to verify the integrity of the data

Fixups are only in data structures, not in sectors with file content

The “signature” is incremented each time the structure is updated



**File identifiers**

Files identified by 64-bit “file record numbers”, which consist of:

1. a file number, corresponding to the (0-based) position in the MFT
2. a sequence number, incremented when a file record is reused

**MFT Entries**

File records start with a fixed header:

followed by attributes (and fixup values):
