## EXT
The Ext (Extended) file system family—Ext2, Ext3, and Ext4—is a series of filesystems used in Linux. These are based on the traditional Unix File System (UFS), but add several modern capabilities over time.

Key Modern Features:

- Extended Attributes / POSIX ACLs: Allow more detailed permissions than traditional Unix read/write/execute.
- Journaling (from Ext3 onwards): Keeps a log (journal) of changes to help recover quickly after crashes.
- Encryption: Protects file contents and filenames (introduced in Ext4).
- 64-bit Support: Allows management of much larger files and filesystems.
- More...

The Ext file systems are modular, with features grouped by their compatibility level:

| Feature Type           | What It Means                                | Example       |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Compatible             | If not supported, OS can still mount the FS normally | has_journal   |
| Incompatible           | If not supported, OS must not mount the FS  | encrypt       |
| Read-Only Compatible   | If not supported, OS can mount in read-only mode | dir_index     |

Support for Very Large Volumes

- Ext3: Limited to volumes up to 16 TB (terabytes), calculated as $16 \cdot 10^{12} / 2^{44}$.
- Ext4: Extends this limit to 1 exabyte (EB), or $10^{18} / 2^{60}$. This makes Ext4 suitable for modern systems with very high storage demands.

Maximum File Size

- Ext3: The maximum size of a single file is 2 TB.
- Ext4: Increases this limit to 16 TB, making it more suitable for applications requiring the management of large files.

Backward Compatibility

- Ext4: Can mount Ext3 file systems and treat them as Ext4. This process is called "on-the-fly conversion": existing files remain in the Ext3 format, but new files will use Ext4's advanced features.
- Ext3: Cannot mount Ext4 file systems, as Ext3 does not support the new features introduced in Ext4.

Extents

Ext4 uses a structure called extents to map data blocks more efficiently. Extents represent a continuous range of blocks, reducing fragmentation and improving performance. This approach is similar to the one used by NTFS (the Windows file system).

### Layout 

In the Ext file system family (Ext2, Ext3, Ext4):

- Sectors (the smallest physical units on a disk, typically 512 bytes) are grouped into \textcolor{blue}{blocks} of 1, 2, or 4 KB.
- These blocks are conceptually similar to "clusters" in FAT or NTFS.
- Unlike the Unix File System (UFS), Ext does not assemble blocks from smaller "fragments." in Ext, the terms "block" and "fragment" are essentially synonymous (the term "block" is predominantly used).
- The \textcolor{blue}{superblock} is located at an offset of 1024 bytes from the start of the volume (not at the very beginning).
It contains all the fundamental parameters of the file system.
- The size of the superblock is 1024 bytes. An optional reserved area may follow the superblock.
- Boot code, if present, resides in the Master Boot Record (MBR) or Volume Boot Record (VBR), not within the file system itself.
- The rest of the file system is divided into \textcolor{blue}{block groups}.


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7 \linewidth]{./media/4.3.0.png}
\end{center}

A key detail: when the first block group (BG0) starts at offset 0:

- The primary superblock is located at an offset of 1024 bytes from the volume start (or within block 0).
- Backup copies of the superblock (if present) are located at the beginning of other block groups (BG1, BG2, etc.).

Each "copy" of the superblock has its own specific metadata.

- This backup structure, with superblock copies in multiple locations, is a critical safety feature that allows recovery even if parts of the file system are damaged.

Each block group

1. contains its data bitmap, inode bitmap, inode table, data blocks
2. may contain the backup of the superblock and the GD table

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7 \linewidth]{./media/4.3.1.png}
\end{center}


Each \textcolor{blue}{group descriptor} defines where to find the components of the block group. 

- The main \textcolor{blue}{group descriptor table} is located in the block immediately following the superblock.
- This table can be copied, after the superblock backup, to all or some groups, depending on the formatting options (see `sparse_super[2]` in the `ext4(5)` man page).

Ext4 introduces advanced options for managing metadata and resizing:

- flexible block groups (`flex_bg`): allows block group metadata to be placed anywhere, not necessarily within the same group.
- \textcolor{blue}{reserved GDT blocks}: enables online resizing of the file system without requiring it to be unmounted.

Standard command `dumpe2fs` prints superblock and group information.

- All groups, except for the last, contain the same number of blocks n
- by default, n is equal to the # of bits in a block: per blocchi di 4 KB (4096 byte), ogni blocco contiene 32.768 bit (4096 × 8), quindi ogni gruppo può gestire 32.768 blocchi
    - the block bitmap is exactly 1 block
- the # of inodes can be chosen at format time, usually less than n


\textcolor{green}{ \rule{\linewidth}{0.25mm}}

### Example

Use `dumpe2fs/fsstat` to list

- block size = 2048 byte
- blocks and inodes per group = 888;296
- number of groups = 18

in the image linus-ext2.dd (SHA256: b6b1836ff1efef3a70...)

- Are there unused sector after the FS? no
total size of fs == 16384*2048 == stat -c %s linus-ext2.dd

- All are group of the same size? no, the end group have a size of 400 blocks

\textcolor{green}{ \rule{\linewidth}{0.25mm}}

Unused space

- The first 1024 bytes are not technically used
- There are unused bytes in the superblock
- There can be unused entries in the GD-table
   - Or they backup copies
- There are the reserved GDT blocks

Those are possible places where to hide data

### Example

1. use `dumpe2fs/fsstat` to check where the superblock copies are
2. dump the first three, and compare them: are they equal?
    - note: the main SB starts at offset 1024, the others at 0
    - are the 2nd and 3rd equal?

```bash
dumpe2fs linus-ext2.dd | grep "superblock"
    ##OUT##
    Primary superblock at 0, Group descriptors at 1-1
    Backup superblock at 888, Group descriptors at 889-889
    Backup superblock at 2664, Group descriptors at 2665-2665
    Backup superblock at 4440, Group descriptors at 4441-4441
    Backup superblock at 6216, Group descriptors at 6217-6217
    Backup superblock at 7992, Group descriptors at 7993-7993
    ###
#The primary superblock is located after the boot block
# the superblock, at volume offset 1024, contains the FS parameters
# the superblock is 1024 bytes in size
dd if=linus-ext2.dd bs=1k skip=1 count=1 of=sb1 

#To convert from filesystem block (2048) numbers to 1KB blocks for dd, you need to multiply by 2:
dd if=linus-ext2.dd bs=1k skip=$((888*2)) count=1 of=sb2
dd if=linus-ext2.dd bs=1k skip=$((2664*2)) count=1 of=sb3 

md5sum sb1 sb2 sb3

    5858141cac833da5d7a0195dfd968119  sb3
    ###


vbindiff sb2 sb3

    ###
    change the bit that keeps track of the superblock group membership
    ###

vbindiff sb1 sb3
    ###
    more diversity because the primary superblock also tines the last path where the fs was mounted (not essential)
    ###

| 4–7        | Starting block address of inode bitmap          | **Yes**       |
| 8–11       | Starting block address of inode table           | **Yes**       |
| 12–13      | Number of unallocated blocks in group           | No        |
| 14–15      | Number of unallocated inodes in group           | No        |

### Inode
Inodes are the primary metadata structure.

- fixed size, defined in the superblock, minimum 128 bytes (`dumpe2fs -h linus-ext2.dd | grep "Inode size"`)
- extra-space can be used to store extended attributes (otherwise, data blocks are used)
- small non-user content can be stored inside direct-block pointer array; e.g., symlink values
- each inode has a unique 'address' or number, starting with 1 (index 0 is not used)
- The inodes of each block group are stored in a table and the position of this table is specified in the block descriptor
- The allocation status of each inode is determined via the inode bitmap nd the position of this table is specified in the block descriptor


Standard commands can be used to inspect the FS:ù

- `-i`,`-lai` in `ls`, shows inode-numbers
- `stat` shows some metadata

debugfs is a FS “debugger” that can display a lot of information.

```bash
ln pippo.txt pippo-hardlink.txt
ln -s pippo.txt pippo-hardlink.txt
ls -li
    ##OUT##
    1445743 -rw-r--r--  2 root    root       0 Apr  3 10:20 pippo-hardlink.txt
    1445746 lrwxrwxrwx  1 root    root       9 Apr  3 10:42 pippo-symblink.txt -> pippo.txt
    1445743 -rw-r--r--  2 root    root       0 Apr  3 10:20 pippo.txt
    ###

    ###
    for symb link we get differen inode number beacsue is 
    the newfile and fs must allocated a new inode and 
    content for symb link. The contet of ippo-symblink.txt is the path " -> pippo.txt", 
    that just a string that is resolved we we tryb to open the pippo-symblink.txt.
    ###
```


Inodes 1 to 10 are reserved

- 1 is (was?) used for keeping track of bad blocks
- 2 is used for the root directory
- 8 is typically for the journal

| 124–127    | Unused                                  | No        |

### Directories

The old directory entry was a simple data structure containing

- the file name (variable length, 1-255 chars) where the length of an entry is rounded up to a multiple of four
- the inode number (AKA index+1)


\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7 \linewidth]{./media/4.3.2.png}
\end{center}

The newer one uses one byte in the filename-length to store the file type.

Allows detecting when an inode has been reassigned (reallocated)!


| Byte Range | Description         | Essential |
|------------|---------------------|-----------|
| 0–3        | Inode value         | **Yes**       |
| 4–5        | Length of this entry| **Yes**       |
| 6–6        | Name length         | **Yes**       |
| 7–7        | File type           | No        |
| 8+         | Name in ASCII       | **Yes**       |

| File Type | Description         |
|-----------|---------------------|
| 1         | Regular file        |
| 2         | Directory           |
| 3         | Character device    |
| 4         | Block device        |
| 5         | FIFO                |
| 6         | Unix Socket         |
| 7         | Symbolic link       |

In ext3 and ext4, option `dir_index` allows the FS to use hashed B-trees to speed up name lookups

- similar to NTFS: This approach is conceptually similar to that used by NTFS in Windows
- when this functionality is active, a `ro-compatible` (read-only compatible) flag is set in the superblock
(This means that systems that do not support this function can still mount the file system, but only in read-only mode)

Still the same directory-entry structures, but in sorted order

- each entry continues to have the same format and contain the same information (Inode value,  Length of this entry ...) but instead of storing the entries in a linear manner (one after the other), the entries are organised in a B-tree structure

### Example

List files in the root directory of linus-ext2.dd by

- (ro) mounting it
- using TSK’s fls
- using ImHex
    - get the block-size from the SB == 1 (=1K)
    - the GD-table is in the block after the SB
    - decode the first GD and get the block for the (first) inode-table
    - the inode n.2 (index 1) is for the root directory
    - the first direct-block-pointer points to the beginning of the directory
    - decode the directory entries


```bash
mount -oro  linus-ext2.dd mnt/linus-ext2
ls -li
    ##OUT##
    total 28
    12 -rw-r----- 2 root root   773 Apr  8  2023 hard_link.txt

### Extended 

Extended attributes are an advanced feature of Ext file systems (Ext2/3/4) that allows additional metadata to be associated with files and directories. This metadata is stored as name-value pairs.

- Ogni attributo è una coppia composta da:
   -  Name: specified in the `namespace.attribute-name format` (current namespaces are security, system, trusted, and user)
   -  Value: An arbitrary datum associated with the name

Gli attributi estesi sono utilizzati per implementare le Access Control Lists (ACL), che consentono di definire permessi più dettagliati rispetto ai tradizionali permessi Unix.

```bash
setfacl -m u:username:rwx file.txt  # Set up an ACL
getfacl file.txt                    # View ACLs
```

kernel and filesystem may place limits on the maximum number and size of extended
attributes that can be associated with a file

Extended attributes are stored in a separate block associated with the file.
If several files share the same attributes, they can use the same block to optimise space.


```bash
getfattr -d file.txt # Display extended attributes

# set an extended attribute
setfattr -n user.comment -v "This is an important file" file.txt 
setfattr -x user.comment file.txt # setfattr -x user.comment file.txt

```
