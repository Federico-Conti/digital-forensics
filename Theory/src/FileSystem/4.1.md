## FAT
The FAT (File Allocation Table) File System is one of the earliest and simplest file systems, first developed in 1977/1978. Over time, it evolved into three main versions: FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32.

The number indicates the # of bits used to identify clusters

- FAT12 can address 212 = 4096 clusters. Windows permits cluster sizes from 512 bytes to
8 KB, which limits FAT12 to 32 MB
- FAT16 can address 216 = 65, 536 clusters
- FAT32 can address 228 clusters (top 4 bits used for other purposes)

Actually, first 2 & last 16 are reserved: usable clusters are slightly less.

Uses the MSDOS 8.3 filename format – Only 8 characters for the name + 3-character file extension (e.g., FILE1234.TXT).

VFAT (Virtual FAT) extends FAT to support long filenames with Unicode, maintaining backward compatibility.

File sizes are stored as 32-bit integers, meaning the largest file size FAT32 can handle is 4 GB.

File sizes are stored as 32-bit integers.


### Volume Organization

In FAT file systems, the storage device is divided into specific regions, each serving a defined role:

- The Volume Boot Record (VBR) contains the so-called BIOS Parameter Block
- The root directory of FAT12/16 has a fixed location and size
- FAT32 boot sector includes the locations of the root directory, FSINFO structure (that
keeps track of free clusters, to optimize allocations), and boot-sector backup (should be 6)

\end{center}


1. Reserved Area

  - Starts at sector 0.
  - Contains the Volume Boot Record (VBR or Boot sector), which holds key information about the file system.
  - FAT12/16: Usually 1 sector (only the VBR); FAT32: Larger because it includes FSINFO structure (helps track free clusters).

2. FAT Area

 - follows the reserved area, and its size is calculated by multiplying the number of
tables by their size

3. Data Area

 - Clusters are only in Data Area, numbered from 2 (!!!) and after the root directory for
FAT12/16
 - Data could be also hidden after the last valid entry in a FAT table

\end{center}


The "Small Sectors" and "Large Sectors" fields represent the total number of sectors in the volume.
Only one of these fields is used, and the other is set to zero.

Green (BIOS Parameter Block - BPB):

- Essential fields required for the basic operation of the file system.
- Defines sector sizes, cluster sizes, and disk structure.

Yellow (Extended BIOS Parameter Block - EBPB):

- Additional metadata introduced in later FAT versions.
- Includes details like the Volume Serial Number, Boot Signature, and Volume Label.

### Files and Directories

A directory entry in FAT file systems is a 32-byte record that stores metadata about a file or directory.

The File Allocation Table (FAT) keeps track of file storage using cluster chains. Each file's data is stored in clusters, and the FAT table links these clusters together to form a chain.

- Each FAT entry points to the next cluster in the file's.
- Clusters marked EOF (End of File) indicate the last cluster of a file.


```fsstat``` decodes this chains (in sectors); special values:

``` 
  0 → not allocated
  0xf...ff0-0xf...f6 → reserved
  0xf...ff7 → damaged
  0xf...ff8-0xf...fff → EOF
```

Note: FAT entries start at 0, but:

- The first addressable cluster #2.
- Entry 0 typically stores a copy of the media type, and entry 1 stores the dirty-status of the file system

### Example
In eighties.dd (SHA256: cc121c3a...) and eighties-all-files.dd (SHA256:e5f16884...) you’ll find two very similar FAT16 (not VFAT) file systems. In the former all
files have been deleted.
Using ImHex.

1. find out:
  Sector and cluster sizes
  Number of reserved sectors
  Locations of: FAT1, FAT2, Root Dir. (=Data Area), first cluster (#2)

compare these results with the output of fsstat

2. check the FAT entries for 48.gif in the two dd-images, and compare the results of
istat on “inode” 5


```bash
fls -r eighties-all-files.dd

  116-119 (4) -> EOF
  120-331 (212) -> EOF
  332-1211 (880) -> EOF
  1212-1279 (68) -> EOF

When a file name exceeds the 8.3 format, the file system creates additional directory entries to store the name in Unicode (2 bytes per character).

These LFN entries are linked together and precede the main directory entry (which still stores the short 8.3 name for compatibility).

- Each LFN entry is marked with the attribute 0x0F, meaning it is not treated as a normal file entry.
- The last LFN entry in the sequence has its sequence number OR-ed with 0x40; or 0xe5 if
unallocated.

When a new directory is created, it contains

. and ..

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5 \linewidth]{./media/4.1.8.png}
\end{center}


those entries can be helpful for carving deleted directories

Since the size of a directory is always 0, the only way to know how many cluster to read is
following the cluster chain


### Example

In eighties-vfat.dd (SHA256: 62258f92ebb42226...) and eighties-vfat-all-files.dd (SHA256: fe46141b98d227cb...) you’ll find two very similar, and familiar, VFAT FAT16 file systems.
As with the previous exercise, in the former all files have been deleted.

Yet, fls -rp eighties-vfat.dd can show the full, long name, for some deleted files but
not for others, that are listed under $OrphanFiles.

1. Can you explain why?
Hint: eighties-vfat-all-files.dd contains some clues

In some cases, even if the file is cacelled, we have the full name, 
and it is strange because in the fat one byte '_' is put above the first character (eighties.dd).
Since we have a vfat there are the entries with the long name and we can trace the original name.
OrphanFiles is a standrd used by TSK when it does not have babstanz ainomraizons to know where that file is.

2. Using ImHex, can you manually recover the full names from eighties-vfat.dd?

```bash
fls -rp eighties-vfat.dd

  r/r * 4:        _
