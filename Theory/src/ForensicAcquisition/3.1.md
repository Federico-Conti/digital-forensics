## Disk encryption: Bitlocker

BitLocker is a full-disk encryption feature in Windows that protects data using a multi-layered encryption system.

It makes use of symmetric encryption (by default, AES-128).

On modern systems, it is coupled with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM):

- the main functions of TPM are the generation, storage and secure management of cryptographic keys
- on a computer without TPM a password can be used (then BitLocker encryption will be just as secure as the password you set)

Bitlocker uses different symmetric key:

1. row data is encrypted with the \textcolor{blue}{Full Volume Encryption Key (FVEK)}
2. FVEK is then encrypted with the \textcolor{blue}{Volume Master Key (VMK)}
3. VMK is in turn encrypted by one of several possible methods depending on the chosen authentication type (that is, \textcolor{blue}{key protectors} or TPM) and recovery scenarios

The use of intermediate key (VMK between FVEK and any key protectors) allows changing the keys without the need to re-encrypt the raw data in a case a given key protector is compromised or changed.

* When changing a key protector, a new VMK will be created and used to encrypt the
old FVEK with the new VMK

BitLocker supports multiple key protector options, depending on the security needs and device type.

**TPM only**

* The TPM module (a hardware security chip) decrypts the VMK using a Storage Root Key (SRK) stored in the TPM.
* The SRK is only released if Secure Boot passes, ensuring the device boots with its original OS and configuration.
* The BitLocker volume is unlocked automatically during boot, before the user logs in.

**TPM + PIN**

* The TPM module will only release the VMK if the user enters a correct PIN during the pre-boot phase.
* If too many incorrect PIN attempts occur, the TPM will lock access to the encryption key, preventing brute-force attacks.

Key Takeaways:

* BitLocker is excellent for protecting against physical threats like device theft or unauthorized hard drive access.
* It does NOT protect against malware, ransomware, or unauthorized logins by users on the same computer.
* TPM + PIN is the most secure option to prevent unauthorized access, even if a device is stolen. 


BitLocker poses a problem for forensic investigators, as all information on the drive will be encrypted, and therefore unreadable. Some methods for breaking BitLocker password are:

* the RAM dump/hibernation file/page file attack: this attack is universal,
and works regardless of the type of protector. It dumps from the computer’s
volatile memory (and possibly in the page/hibernation file) the VMK that is
loaded unencrypted while the volume is mounted
* BitLocker recovery keys: in many situations recovery keys are be stored in
the user’s Microsoft Account. Extracting those keys from their account
allows instantly mounting or decrypting protected volumes regardless of the
type of protector

## Toolset and examples

A **loop** device is a special kind of block device that does not map to a physical hardware device (such as a hard disk) but instead maps to a regular file stored within a filesystem.

* useful to access a forensic image
* read/only can be forced
* the offset parameter could be useful to
directly access a volume
* (can be used to simulate a block device to
be acquired)

Key losetup Commands:

- ```losetup -a ```→ Shows the status of all loop devices.
- ```losetup -d [device]``` → Detaches a loop device.
- ```losetup -f``` → Finds the first available (unused) loop device.
- ```losetup -o [offset]``` → Starts reading data at a specific offset in the file.
- ```losetup -r /dev/loop0 [srcfile]``` → Sets up a read-only loop device.

**dd** is the precursor of all acquisition tools, allowing for the acquisition of data bit
by bit in raw format.

Key ```dd``` Options:

* ```if=``` → Input file (or device to copy from).
* ```of=``` → Output file (or device to write to).
* ```bs=``` → Block size (how much data to read/write at a time).
* ```conv=``` → Specifies conversion options (e.g., noerror to continue on errors).

*Example*

```sh
dd if=/dev/sda of=/mnt/dest/image.dd bs=512
```

### losetup and dd

In this exercise, we will simulate a block device using a compressed forensic image and interact with it as if it were a real disk.

```sh
wget https://github.com/enricorusso/DF_Exs/raw/main/acquisition/image.dd.gz
gunzip image.dd.gz

# Before setting up the loop device, find an available one using
lsblk
losetup -f

sudo losetup -r /dev/loop1 image.dd # Now, set up the image as a read-only loop device

sudo dmesg | tail # To verify that the loop device was correctly attached, check system logs
[84058.342422] loop1: detected capacity change from 0 to 2033664

sudo fdisk -l /dev/loop1 # To inspect the loop device and view partition details

# Since the loop device represents an entire disk, 
# Linux does not automatically recognize partitions. 
# Use partx to make them available
sudo partx -a /dev/loop1 

mkdir -p /mnt/forensic_image
sudo mount -o ro /dev/loop1p1 /mnt/forensic_image

ls -l /mnt/forensic_image

#clean 
sudo umount /mnt/forensic_image
sudo losetup -d /dev/loop1
```

In digital forensics, verifying the integrity of a forensic image is crucial to ensure that the data remains unchanged during analysis. This is done by calculating cryptographic hash values (MD5 and SHA1) before and after mounting the image → Before using the forensic image, compute its MD5 and SHA1 hashes.

\clearpage

The ```dd``` tool does not calculate hashes during acquisition, so forensic best practices require manually computing hashes before and after imaging to ensure data integrity.

```sh

# Instead of separately computing hashes before and after, we can stream data from dd to tee, simultaneously writing to a file (image.dd) and calculating hashes on-the-fly
sudo dd if=/dev/loop1 bs=512 | tee image.dd 
| hashdeep -c md5,sha1 > image.src_hash #apt install hashdeep

# dd if=/dev/loop1 bs=512 → Reads data from the loop device.
# tee image.dd → Writes data to image.dd while also passing it to the next command.
# hashdeep -c md5,sha1 → Computes MD5 and SHA1 hashes as data is written.
# > image.src_hash → Saves the computed hashes to image.src_hash.

#Finale verification hash
md5sum image.dd

```

### A faulty disk

In this exercise, we simulate a faulty disk by mapping a logical block device and introducing bad sectors. We then attempt to acquire it using dd, handling errors properly to maintain forensic integrity.


1. We create a logical “faulty” device (1Kb) with the command dmsetup*

    - ```8 8 error``` → [starting sector; add sector] maps the next 8 sectors of 512 byte (8 to 16) of the bad_disk device to an error area. This means that any attempt to read or write to bad_disk sectors 8 to 16 will generate an error.
    - ```/dev/loop1``` is the origin and must be initialized with a .dd (```sudo losetup /dev/loop0 image.dd```/)

    ```sh
    sudo dmsetup create bad_disk << EOF
    0 8 linear /dev/loop0 0 
    8 8 error
    16 2033648 linear /dev/loop0 16
    EOF
    ```

2. Scan the simulated bad sectors.

    ```sh
     sh sudo badblocks -b 512 -v /dev/mapper/bad_disk 
    ```

3. To ensure that all reads go directly to the faulty device (and are not cached), we disable readahead. Then, check the block device size:

    ```sh
     sudo blockdev --setra 0 /dev/mapper/bad_disk
     sudo blockdev --getsz /dev/mapper/bad_disk
    ```

4. Now, try acquiring the faulty disk with dd

    ```sh
     sudo dd if=/dev/mapper/bad_disk of=bad.dd bs=512
    ```

     Problem: dd stops when it hits a bad sector,       preventing a complete acquisition.

5. To log bad sectors and replace them with zeros, use ```conv=sync,noerror```
    * ```tee bad.dd``` → Writes the output to bad.dd while streaming it to ```hashdeep``` for hashing.

    ```sh
      sudo dd if=/dev/mapper/bad_disk bs=512 conv=sync,noerror 
      | tee bad.dd | hashdeep -c md5,sha1 > bad_image.src_hash

    ```

6. After acquisition, compare the hash of bad.dd to the hash calculated during acquisition in ```bad_image.src_hash```

    ```sh
      hashdeep -c md5,sha1 bad.dd
    ```

### dc3dd

An enhanced version of dd designed specifically for digital forensics. It was developed by the DoD Cyber Crime Center (DC3) and includes several critical forensic features missing in standard dd.

*Example*

```sh
sudo dc3dd if=/dev/mapper/bad_disk of=bad.dd ssz=512 log=image.log hlog=hash.log hash=md5 hash=sha1
```

### Image file formats

When acquiring digital evidence, the choice of image format is crucial for integrity, compatibility, and efficiency in analysis. There are two main categories of forensic image formats.

The output from dd acquisition is a raw image
*  it contains only the data from the source device
* all the descriptive data about the acquisition (e.g., hashes values, dates, or times) need to be
saved in a separate file

An embedded image contains data from the source device and additional descriptive data (metadata).

* **Expert Witness Format (EWF)**
    
    Joachim Metz (Google) created the libewf project, open source (\url{https://github.com/libyal/libewf}, apt
    install ewf-tools). It provides a library and set of tools to manage the ewf format.

    * ```ewfacquire```: reads storage media data from devices and write files to EWF files.
    * ```ewfexport```: exports storage media data in EWF files to (split) RAW format or a specific version of
    EWF files.
    * ```ewfinfo```: shows the metadata in EWF files.
    * ```ewfmount```: FUSE mounts EWF files.
    * ```ewfrecover```: special variant of ewfexport to create a new set of EWF files from a corrupt set.
    * ```ewfverify```: verifies the storage media data in EWF files

(FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) is a Linux kernel module that allows users to mount and manage file systems without requiring root privileges or kernel modifications.) --> alternative ```:uses sudo ewfmount```

* **Advanced Forensic Format (AFF)**

    Open Source format developed by Dr. Simson L. Garfinkel

    * Provide compressed or uncompressed image files
    * No size restriction for disk-to-image files
    * Provide space in the image file or segmented files for metadata (unlimited number)
    * Digital signatures
    * Encryption with decryption on-the-fly
    * No patents

    Still lacks wide adoption (software available at \url{https://github.com/sshock/AFFLIBv3}).

### Guymager

Guymager is a graphical (Qt-based) forensic imager. It is capable of producing image
files in EWF, AFF and dd format (apt install guymager).

* AFF is disabled by default (```sudo nano /etc/guymager/guymager.cfg → set AffEnabled=true →  sudo systemctl restart guymager```)
 

### FTK Imager

FTK Imager is a data preview and imaging tool used to acquire data
(evidence) in a forensically sound manner by creating copies of data without
making changes to the original evidence (\url{https://www.exterro.com/ftk-product-downloads}).
