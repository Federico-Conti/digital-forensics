## Wireshark

[Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) is a tool to capture data from a network (sniffer) and to analyse them

- Analysis can be performed in real-time or on previously-recorded traffic files, through, e.g., packet
capture or PCAP
- Packets represent generic chunks of data and, depending on the considered level, can be interpreted as frames, datagram, or segment
